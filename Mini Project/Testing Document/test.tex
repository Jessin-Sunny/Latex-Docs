\section{Introduction}
The Fasttrack Delivery system is designed to streamline package delivery operations through following integrated components:
\begin{itemize}
    \item A Flutter-based mobile application for delivery personnel.
    \item A comprehensive website for company management and administrative tasks.
    \item A Flask-based backend API for processing package data and assignments.
    \item A Firebase Firestore for real-time data updates, secure authentication, and data storage.
    \item A Google Maps API for displaying map data and routes.
\end{itemize}


\subsection{System Overview}
The Fasttrack Delivery system comprises three main components:

\subsubsection{Flutter Mobile Application}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User Authentication:} Secure login using Firebase Authentication.
    \item \textbf{Employee Assignment \& Package Tracking:} Delivery personnel can view assigned packages, scan their assigned packages, and monitor real-time progress.
    \item \textbf{Google Maps Integration:} Provides dynamic, real-time navigation and route optimization.
    \item \textbf{Notifications:} Firebase Cloud Messaging alerts employees about new assignments and status changes.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Website}
The website serves as the control center for companies and administrators:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Company Registration and Management:} 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item \texttt{register.html}, \texttt{login.html}, and \texttt{forgot.html} enable secure user registration and login.
       \item \texttt{CompanyD.html}, \texttt{AfterReg.html}, and \texttt{dashboard.html} provide interfaces for companies to manage their profiles and view key metrics.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Package Upload and Assignment:} 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item \texttt{UploadPack.html} and \texttt{package.html} facilitate the upload of daily package details and trigger assignment algorithms.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Administrative Functions:} 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Admin pages such as \texttt{AdminApp.html}, \texttt{AdminCD.html}, \texttt{AdminComplaints.html}, \texttt{AdminCV.html}, \texttt{Admindashboard.html}, \texttt{AdminRC.html}, \texttt{AdminReport.html}, and \texttt{AdminV.html} allow administrators to verify new company registrations, manage complaints, generate reports, and oversee system operations.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Employee Management:} 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Pages like \texttt{EmployeeD.html}, \texttt{EmployeePD.html}, \texttt{EmployeeR.html}, \texttt{Edit\_SelectE.html}, \texttt{SelectBE.html}, and \texttt{SelectTE.html} help companies manage employee records and assign delivery tasks.
    \end{itemize}
    \item \textbf{General Information:} 
    \begin{itemize}
       \item Additional pages (\texttt{about.html}, \texttt{contact.html}, \texttt{privacy.html}, \texttt{Terms.html}, etc.) provide information about the project, contact details, and legal policies.
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Backend (Flask API)}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Data Processing:} Fetches package data from Firebase, processes assignments, and updates records.
    \item \textbf{QR Code Generation:} Generates QR codes for tracking packages.
    \item \textbf{Real-Time Updates:} Ensures synchronization between the mobile application and the website using Firebase Firestore.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{Modules}
The Fasttrack Delivery system is organized into the following key modules:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{User Authentication:} Secure login and registration for both employees and companies.
    \item \textbf{Employee Management:} Registration, management, and assignment of delivery personnel.
    \item \textbf{Package Upload and Assignment:} Upload of package details and automatic assignment based on workload.
    \item \textbf{Google Maps Integration and Route Optimization:} Real-time navigation with dynamic route optimization.

\end{enumerate}
